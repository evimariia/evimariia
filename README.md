# Welcome to my space 🌼
Hi, I'm glad you're here! I'm Évila Carneiro, but you can call me Évi. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at UniCEUB and I'm passionate for the data world and its possibilities. I believe from the bottom of my heart that learning about all aspects of life helps me become a better person and contribute positively to my community, that's why I value study and knowledge so much. In this long and endless journey of searching for knowledge I have already crossed paths with different aspects within the world of programming, such as multilayer projects, design patterns (regards to Uncle Bob!), automated tests, competitive programming, microcontrollers programing, databases (my fav so far) and another ones. I also like studying about science, marketing, fashion, music, arts and the universe. I'm open to contributing to new projects that helps with society's problems, feel free to get in touch. [Contact me](evilam.scarneiro@gmail.com)!
